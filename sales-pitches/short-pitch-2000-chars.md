## Under 2000 Characters

"Hi [Name], I'm Jeremy Kermicle from Kermicle Media in Owenton. I help Northern Kentucky businesses automate time-wasting tasks so you can focus on growth.

**Quick question:** How many hours weekly do you spend on billing, scheduling, customer emails, and data entry? Most business owners say 15-20 hours.

**Here's what I do:** I automate those routine tasks using AI. Your customers get instant responses 24/7, appointments book themselves, invoices generate automatically, and leads get followed up without you lifting a finger.

**Three packages:**
- Starter ($2,200): Basic automation, saves 8 hours/week
- Professional ($6,999): Complete automation, saves 15-20 hours/week  
- Enterprise ($15,999): Advanced automation, saves 25+ hours/week

**My recommendation:** Professional Package at $6,999. If your time is worth $50/hour, that's $39,000-$52,000 in annual savings for a $7,000 investment.

**Why me?** I'm local (30 minutes away), specialize in small businesses, and implement in 4 weeks vs 6 months. 50% cheaper than national firms.

**Payment options:** $3,500 down, $3,499 after you see results. Or full payment with 5% discount.

**Next step:** Free 2-hour assessment at your location. I'll show exactly which processes we can automate and calculate your specific ROI.

What questions do you have? When works for that assessment?"
