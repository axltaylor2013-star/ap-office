## 🎯 **OPENING: THE NORTHERN KENTUCKY OPPORTUNITY**

"Hi [Name], thanks for taking my call. I'm Jeremy Kermicle from Kermicle Media here in Owenton. I help Northern Kentucky businesses like yours eliminate the time-wasting manual tasks that keep you from focusing on what really grows your business.

I've been working with businesses in Frankfort, Dry Ridge, and Carrollton, and I keep seeing the same pattern - successful business owners spending way too much time on repetitive admin work instead of serving customers and growing revenue.

Let me show you exactly how AI automation can change that for [Business Name]."

## 📊 **WHAT YOU'RE PROBABLY DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW**

"Before I show you the solution, let's talk about what's eating up your time every day:

### **Administrative Time Drain:**
- How much time do you spend each week on billing, invoicing, and payment follow-ups?
- What about scheduling appointments, sending reminders, and handling no-shows?
- How many customer service emails and calls could probably be handled automatically?

### **Manual Customer Management:**
- Are you manually tracking leads in spreadsheets or Post-it notes?
- How do you follow up with prospects who didn't buy immediately?
- What happens to customer inquiries that come in after hours or on weekends?

### **Operational Inefficiencies:**
- How much time goes to data entry, report generation, and filing?
- Are you manually coordinating between team members on projects?
- What about order processing, inventory updates, and vendor communications?

**Here's the thing** - if you're spending more than 20% of your time on these routine tasks, you're leaving money on the table. Every hour you spend on admin is an hour you're not spending on high-value activities that actually grow your business."
