COLD EMAIL FOR Broadlinc ISP
============================

TO: [Broadlinc Management Email]
SUBJECT: Could Broadlinc save $122,000 monthly through AI automation?

Hi [Name],

I'm Jeremy Kermicle from Kermicle Media, based here in Owenton. I specialize in AI automation for regional ISPs like Broadlinc.

I've analyzed ISP operations similar to yours and found that Broadlinc could potentially save $1.4 million annually through targeted automation - with a payback period of just 3 weeks.

**Here's what I'm seeing for ISPs your size:**
• 63% reduction in customer service calls through AI chatbots
• 60% fewer tech support calls via predictive network monitoring  
• 40% reduction in truck rolls through automated diagnostics
• 25% improvement in customer retention through AI-powered outreach

**For Broadlinc specifically, this translates to:**
• $122,677 in monthly operational savings
• $35,000 one-time implementation investment
• 4,106% ROI in the first year

The automation handles password resets, billing questions, service status checks, and proactively prevents network outages before customers even notice issues.

As a local Northern Kentucky consultant, I understand the unique challenges regional ISPs face - and why local, personalized service matters more than generic enterprise solutions.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call to discuss how these numbers might apply to Broadlinc's specific operations? I can provide a more detailed analysis after understanding your current call volumes and operational structure.

I'm offering a performance guarantee - if you don't achieve 80% of projected savings within 6 months, I'll provide additional optimization work at no charge.

Best regards,
Jeremy Kermicle
