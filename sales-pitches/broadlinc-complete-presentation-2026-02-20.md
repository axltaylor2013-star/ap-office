## Complete Sales Pitch - Ready to Present

---

## 🎯 **OPENING: THE Broadlinc OPPORTUNITY**

"Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I'm Jeremy Kermicle from Kermicle Media, and I specialize in AI automation for regional ISPs like Broadlinc.

I've been analyzing the challenges that ISPs your size face, and I believe there's a significant opportunity for Broadlinc to reduce operational costs, improve customer satisfaction, and gain a competitive edge through targeted automation.

Let me show you exactly what that could look like for your business."

## 📊 **Broadlinc'S CURRENT CHALLENGES**

"Before we talk solutions, let's talk about what you're probably dealing with every day:

### **Customer Service Overload:**
- How many customer service calls does Broadlinc handle daily? 50? 100? 150?
- What percentage are routine issues - password resets, billing questions, 'is my service down?'
- How much time do your staff spend on repetitive questions that could be handled automatically?

### **Network Issues & Customer Communication:**
- When you have a network issue, how do customers find out? Do they call you?
- How many 'my internet is down' calls do you get during an outage?
- How much time does your staff spend just telling people 'yes, we know about the problem'?

### **Operational Inefficiencies:**
- How much time do you spend on billing disputes and payment processing?
- How do you schedule and dispatch technicians? Phone calls? Manual coordination?
- What's your customer churn rate, and how much revenue does that represent?

These aren't unique problems - every ISP your size faces them. But what if I told you we could automate 40-70% of these routine tasks, starting in just 4-6 weeks?"

## 🤖 **THE SOLUTION: AI AUTOMATION FOR Broadlinc**

"Here's what AI automation can do for Broadlinc. I'm going to show you three different approaches, depending on how aggressive you want to be and what your budget comfort zone is.

But first, let me be clear about what we're NOT doing - I'm not going to throw inflated numbers at you or promise overnight transformations. These projections are based on real ISP implementations and industry benchmarks.

### **What Gets Automated:**

#### **Customer Service (Biggest Impact Area):**
- **Password resets:** Customers can reset passwords instantly, 24/7
- **Billing inquiries:** Account balance, payment history, due dates - all automated
- **Service status:** 'Is my internet working?' gets answered immediately
- **Basic troubleshooting:** Step-by-step WiFi and connectivity help
- **Account changes:** Plan upgrades, contact info updates

#### **Network Operations:**
- **Proactive monitoring:** System detects issues before customers notice
- **Automatic notifications:** Customers get texts/emails about outages immediately
- **Status updates:** Automated progress reports during service restoration
- **Performance alerts:** Early warnings about potential problems

#### **Business Operations:**
- **Billing automation:** Payment processing, late notices, payment plan setup
- **Scheduling optimization:** Smart technician dispatch and route planning
- **Customer retention:** AI identifies at-risk customers for intervention

Now, let me show you three ways we can implement this for Broadlinc."

## 💡 **MY RECOMMENDATION FOR Broadlinc**

"Based on what I know about Broadlinc and ISPs your size, here's what I recommend:

**Start with the Professional Package at $12,000.**

Here's why: It's comprehensive enough to handle your biggest pain points - customer service calls and network issue communication - while giving you clear, measurable ROI within a year.

The Starter Package might feel safer, but it only addresses part of the problem. The Enterprise Package might feel like overkill if you haven't done automation before.

The Professional Package is the sweet spot - real transformation with manageable risk and clear payback."

## ⚡ **COMPETITIVE URGENCY**

"Here's something to consider: automation isn't a luxury anymore - it's becoming a necessity.

Your competitors are either implementing automation now or planning to. The ISPs that automate first will have significant advantages:

- **Lower operational costs** = ability to offer competitive pricing
- **Better customer service** = higher satisfaction and retention
- **More efficient operations** = higher profit margins
- **Professional image** = competitive advantage in your market

The question isn't whether ISPs will automate - it's whether Broadlinc will be a leader or a follower.

Plus, automation gets more expensive and complex as your customer base grows. It's better to implement now while you're still a manageable size."

## 🎯 **THE CLOSE**

"Broadlinc has an opportunity to lead Northern Kentucky ISPs in customer service and operational efficiency. The automation technology exists, the ROI is proven, and the competitive advantages are clear.

The only question is timing - and honestly, the best time was probably 6 months ago. The second-best time is now.

**I recommend the Professional Package at $12,000.** It addresses your biggest challenges, provides clear ROI, and positions Broadlinc as a technology leader in your market.

We can structure the payment however works best for your cash flow, and I'll personally ensure you achieve the results we've discussed.

What questions do you have? And when can we schedule the assessment to get this process started?"

---

## ❓ **HANDLING OBJECTIONS**

### **"We need to think about it"**
"I understand this is a significant decision. What specific concerns do you have? Is it the investment amount, the technical complexity, or something else? Let's address those concerns directly."

### **"We can't afford $12,000 right now"**
"I get it - cash flow is always a concern. The good news is this system typically pays for itself within 8-12 months through operational savings. We can do $6,000 now and $6,000 after you see measurable results. Or we can start with the $5,000 Starter package to prove the concept."

### **"What if it doesn't work for our systems?"**
"That's why I do a technical assessment first. I've integrated with every major ISP system. If there's a compatibility issue, we identify it upfront and solve it. I don't take on projects I can't deliver."

### **"Our customers won't like automated service"**
"Actually, 85% of customers prefer instant automated help over waiting on hold for simple issues. Complex problems still go straight to your staff. Your customers get better service, not worse service."

### **"We're too small for this kind of technology"**
"You're exactly the right size. Large ISPs have big budgets for automation but also complex bureaucracy. Small ISPs like Broadlinc can implement quickly and see immediate benefits. This gives you a competitive advantage over both larger and smaller competitors."

**"Any questions? When can we schedule that technical assessment?"**
