# **FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

## **💡 GENERAL QUESTIONS**

### **Q: How is this different from other AI tools like ChatGPT?**
**A:** While ChatGPT is a conversational tool, our system is a complete business automation platform. We provide specialized AI agents that are trained for specific business functions, integrated with your existing workflows, and capable of taking actions on your behalf—not just providing information.

### **Q: Do I need technical expertise to use this system?**
**A:** No. Our system is designed for business users, not technical experts. We provide complete setup, training, and ongoing support. Most clients are fully operational within 48 hours with no technical knowledge required.

### **Q: Will this replace my employees?**
**A:** Our AI agents augment and empower your human team rather than replace them. They handle repetitive, time-consuming tasks so your people can focus on strategy, creativity, and high-value activities that require human judgment and relationship skills.

### **Q: What if my business is very specialized/unique?**
**A:** We specialize in custom solutions. Our AI agents can be trained on your specific processes, terminology, and requirements. We've successfully implemented solutions across dozens of industries from healthcare to manufacturing to creative services.

## **💰 PRICING & INVESTMENT**

### **Q: Is this really a one-time payment?**
**A:** For the AI system and hardware, yes—it's a one-time investment. The only ongoing costs are optional support services ($200/month) and any custom development work you request. The dashboard licensing option also offers unlimited client installations for a one-time fee.

### **Q: What about ongoing costs and maintenance?**
**A:** Basic maintenance and updates are included for 12 months. After that, optional support is available for $200/month, which includes updates, monitoring, and technical support. Many clients operate independently after the first year.

### **Q: Can I pay in installments?**
**A:** Yes. We offer flexible payment plans including monthly installments over 6, 12, or 24 months. We also accept purchase orders from established businesses and can work with your finance team on custom arrangements.

### **Q: What's your refund/guarantee policy?**
**A:** We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied with the system performance and ROI within 30 days, we'll refund your investment. We also provide a performance guarantee—if the system doesn't meet the agreed-upon benchmarks, we'll continue working until it does.

## **🔧 TECHNICAL QUESTIONS**

### **Q: How secure is the system?**
**A:** Security is our top priority. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest, we use enterprise-grade security protocols, and the system can operate entirely on your own infrastructure if required. We're compliant with GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2 standards.

### **Q: What happens to my data?**
**A:** Your data remains yours. We never access, store, or use your business data for any purpose other than operating your specific AI agents. You maintain complete control and ownership of all data at all times.

### **Q: How does this integrate with my existing tools?**
**A:** Our system is designed to integrate with virtually any business software through APIs, webhooks, and direct database connections. Common integrations include Salesforce, HubSpot, QuickBooks, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Shopify, and hundreds of others.

### **Q: What if I need custom features or integrations?**
**A:** Custom development is available at $150/hour with most custom projects ranging from $1,500-$5,000. We can integrate with proprietary systems, create custom workflows, and develop specialized AI skills for your unique requirements.

## **🚀 GETTING STARTED**

### **Q: How long does implementation take?**
**A:** Standard implementation is completed within 48 hours for most businesses. Complex enterprise implementations may take 1-2 weeks. We work around your schedule to minimize disruption to your operations.

### **Q: What do I need to prepare?**
**A:** Very little. We handle most of the preparation work. You'll need to provide access to the systems you want integrated and participate in a few planning sessions to customize the solution for your specific needs.

### **Q: Can I see a demo before purchasing?**
**A:** Absolutely. We provide detailed demonstrations tailored to your specific business needs. We can show you exactly how the system would work in your environment and provide ROI projections based on your current operations.
