- Generated 31 images for EP01 animatic (5 char sheets + 1 env + 25 panels)
- ~10 sec per panel on RTX 4060
- Note: SD 1.5 CLIP truncates at 77 tokens — prompts get cut off. Consider SDXL for quality upgrade.

## EP01 Animatic — COMPLETE (Draft)

## Business Strategy Discussion
- Jeremy doesn't want to sell photo/video editing yet — no portfolio samples, doesn't want to put out bad product
- Pivoting to: AI Setup-as-a-Service, Social Media Management, AI Consulting/Automation
- The dashboard IS the portfolio — show clients the hub and say "I built this in 2 days"
- Still need: Jeremy's city for local lead gen, his social media handles for analytics

## Mule & Forge Assigned Dashboard QA
- Mule: testing all 13 pages, improving seed data, writing QA report
- Forge: code review, bug fixes, consistency polish across all pages
- Reports expected at mule-output/dashboard-qa-2026-02-15.md and workspace-forge/dashboard-fixes-2026-02-15.md

## Scout — Now on Grok 2
- xAI API key configured (xai-eZ9y...)
- Scout model set to xai/grok-2
- Scout's Telegram bot still broken (session path bug) but works via sessions_send internally
- Can be used as 4th worker agent — relay through Jarvis
- Agent lineup: Jarvis (Opus), Scout (Grok 2), Mule (Opus), Forge (Opus)

## Scout — FIXED & OPERATIONAL (Evening)
- Session path bug resolved after OpenClaw reinstall + session resets
- grok-2 model was 404ing (xAI API key doesn't have access) — that was why Scout appeared broken on Telegram
- Fixed: removed all models except Google Gemini 2.0 Flash from Scout's models.json
- Scout now responds on Telegram DMs AND via sessions_send
- Built 8 skills for Scout: web-researcher, trend-scout, lead-finder, price-intel, content-scout, news-briefing, tool-finder, opportunity-radar
- Skills at workspace-scout2/skills/
- Scout delivered trend report at reports/trends/2026-02-15.md

## Forge & Mule — Telegram DMs Fixed
- After OpenClaw 2026.2.13 reinstall + session resets, all agents respond on Telegram again
- Forge on Qwen2.5-Coder 7B (local/free), Mule on Llama 3.1 8B (local/free)
- Can't run both local models simultaneously — 16GB RAM not enough
- Swap between them as needed

## OpenClaw Update
- Updated from 2026.2.12 to 2026.2.13
- Failed downgrade attempt corrupted dist/ folder — reinstall fixed it
- Lesson: NEVER uninstall/downgrade without asking Jeremy first

## Watchdog Popup Fix
- OpenClaw Watchdog scheduled task was popping up visible PowerShell window every 5 min
- Created VBS wrapper at C:\Users\alfre\bin\gateway-watchdog-hidden.vbs
- Also created C:\Users\alfre\bin\gateway-hidden.vbs for the gateway
- Deleted and recreated watchdog task to use wscript.exe wrapper — runs invisible now

## Jeremy's Kid
- #22 on Owen County Runnin' Rebels basketball team
- Won 2026 NCKC Boys 3rd Grade Tournament — CHAMPIONS
- Created 3 photo edits: ESPN breaking news, movie poster, trading card

## Roblox Game — Overnight Project
- Jeremy wants a Roblox game concept + testable code by morning
- Scout researching trending games, profitable niches, viral mechanics
- Forge building reusable Lua game framework (PlayerData, GameManager, UI, Currency)
- Phase 2: synthesize research into game concept, send to Forge for specific code
- Phase 3: full game scripts + design doc + testing guide

## Client Intake Form
- Built at workspace-forge/projects/client-intake-form/client-intake.html
- Dark theme, gold accents, Kermicle Media branding
- Fields: name, business, email, phone, services checkboxes, description, budget, timeline
- Generates JSON on submit — no backend needed

## Crypto Dashboard
- Already built at dashboard/portfolio.html
- Pulls live from CoinGecko + DexScreener
- Jeremy's portfolio ~$725-773 (fluctuating)
- Holdings: USDC, MOLT, UXRP, CLAWD, RIPS, ETH
- Jeremy wants it local only, not on GitHub Pages

## Mac Studio Discussion
- Jeremy looking at Mac Studio M3 Ultra 256GB ($7-8K) for running LLMs locally
- 256GB can run Llama 405B quantized — near-Opus quality, zero API costs
- M4 Max 128GB ($4-5K) good for 70B models
- Current setup (API + local models) is most cost-effective for now
- Makes sense if scaling to 10+ clients paying $200/mo each
