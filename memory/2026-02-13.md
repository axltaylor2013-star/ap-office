# 2026-02-13 — Day 1

## What Happened
- First boot. Jeremy named me Jarvis.
- Set up Telegram bot (@howard32bot) — had to enable plugin at both channel AND plugin level
- Jeremy wants me: professional, goal-oriented, helpful, funny, always looking to make him money
- Jeremy's business: photo/video editing — **Kermicle Media**
- Built website (kermiclemedia.com) — dark cinematic theme, gold accents
  - Added pricing (industry standard minus 10%)
  - Added portfolio photos (baseball B&W, muddy football kid)
  - Added Jeremy's headshot with dog to About section
  - Fixed encoding issues (mojibake) multiple times — lesson: always write UTF-8 clean
- Bought domain on Namecheap, pushed to GitHub Pages (axltaylor2013-star/kermiclemedia)
- DNS configured (4 A records + CNAME), waiting to propagate
- Email: using alfred.pennyworth32@gmail.com for now, may switch to Zoho later

## Local Agents Set Up
- **Mule** 🫏 — Llama 3.1 8B, @mule32bot on Telegram, general worker, $0 cost
  - Had session file path issue (absolute vs relative) — fixed by making sessionFile relative in sessions.json
  - dmPolicy set to allowlist with Jeremy's Telegram ID (8525420933)
- **Forge** 🔨 — Qwen2.5-Coder 7B, Telegram bot configured, coding specialist, $0 cost
  - Same session file path issue — fixed same way
  - Forge responded to Jeremy on Telegram

## Dashboard
- Built web-based Kermicle Command Center dashboard
- Having connection issues from file:// URL, moved to canvas server

## Lessons Learned
- Telegram plugin must be enabled at both channel AND plugin level
- Session file paths should be relative, not absolute (caused "must be within sessions directory" error)
- Always confirm to Jeremy when something is done — don't leave him hanging
- Always pull up the website after making changes (Jeremy's request)
- PowerShell can't handle special characters in inline commands — use .js script files instead
- Multi-agent Telegram: use accounts + bindings, set dmPolicy to allowlist with user ID
- Encoding: always write HTML files as proper UTF-8, avoid mojibake

## Jeremy's Info
- Has kids (baseball + football)  
- Has a small dog
- Telegram ID: 8525420933
- GitHub: axltaylor2013-star
- Email: alfred.pennyworth32@gmail.com
- Machine: i7-13700HX, RTX 4060 8GB, 16GB RAM

## AP Technologies
- Jeremy wants to buy 2x Apple Mac Studios with 512GB unified memory each ($25K investment)
- Created investment proposal: `workspace/website/ap-technologies.html`
- Current setup isn't strong enough to sell AI services — Mac Studios are the goal
- Plan: Jeremy gets the money, Jarvis keeps building skills & training Mule/Forge
- Morning report cron set: 8AM ET daily — report on training progress, update training-log.json
- Dashboard updated with 🧠 Training & Skills Log section (filters by agent, tracks entries)
- Training log stored in localStorage + `workspace/training-log.json`

## TODO
- Get kermiclemedia.com DNS propagated and live
- Fix dashboard WebSocket connection
- More portfolio content for website
- Set up social media presence
- Start client outreach
