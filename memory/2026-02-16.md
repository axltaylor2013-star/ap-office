## New Project: Roblox MMO Game
- Jeremy wants to build a RuneScape-inspired Roblox game
- Key feature: full-loot PvP wilderness (risk everything you carry)
- Inspired by "Derelict" (RuneScape x Soulslike Roblox game)
- Jeremy will get Roblox Studio set up in the morning
- Scout assigned to research: top Roblox MMOs, DevEx economics, tech stack, MVP scope

## Roblox Studio Setup
- Downloaded and installed Roblox Studio via direct CDN link
- Hit 403 Forbidden from Roblox CDN initially — cleared cache and retried
- Installed Rojo v7.6.1 (C:\Users\alfre\bin\rojo.exe) + Studio plugin for file→Studio syncing

## Key Bugs Found & Fixed
1. **Rojo deleting Workspace parts** — Missing `$ignoreUnknownInstances: true` in project.json. Rojo was wiping baseplate, spawn, border on connect. ALWAYS set this on Workspace.
2. **DataStore crash on unpublished place** — "You must publish this place to the web to access DataStore" killed ALL server scripts. Fixed with pcall wrapper and in-memory fallback.
3. **Can't require() a Script** — DataManager was .server.lua (Script) but other scripts tried to require() it. Moved to ModuleScript in ReplicatedStorage/Modules.
4. **Tree ClickDetector only on trunk** — Clicking leaves did nothing. Fixed by adding ClickDetector to leaves too. Changed trunk from rotated Cylinder to upright Block.
5. **Race condition** — SkillManager tried WaitForChild("ResourceNodes") before MapSetup created it. Added task.wait(2) + fallback creation.
6. **Command bar can't handle large scripts** — Multi-line pastes don't work. Use server Scripts that run on game start instead.

## Game Progress — "Wilderness" (working title)
- Built full project structure with Rojo (src/ServerScriptService, src/ReplicatedStorage/Modules, src/StarterPlayerScripts)
- **Working systems**: Config, ItemDatabase (22 items), DataManager (with DataStore fallback), SkillManager (gathering), CombatManager (PvP), WildernessManager (zone detection + full-loot death), BankManager (NPC + deposit/withdraw), MapSetup (world generation)
- **Client UI**: Skills panel, inventory, zone indicator, level-up notifications, damage numbers, gather feedback, full bank UI with deposit/withdraw
- **City of Haven**: Stone walls, gate with torches, town square with fountain, bank building, general store, smithy with forge + cooking range, chapel with steeple, cobblestone paths, barrels/crates/benches
- **Wilderness**: Dark ground, dead trees, skull warning signs, ancient ruins, lava pit
- **Resource nodes**: Copper/Iron/Gold/Runite rocks, Oak/Willow/Yew/Magic trees, Shrimp/Trout/Lobster/Dark Crab fishing spots. Better resources in wilderness (risk/reward).

## All Agents Focused on Roblox
- Jeremy's directive: "scratch everything else, focus all effort on this game"
- Scout: 18 skills, researching Roblox MMOs, DevForum, monetization, game names
- Forge: standby for Luau coding tasks
- Mule: on hold
- Built roblox-game-builder skill, shared across all agents
- Scout tasked with 25 game name ideas

## Scout Upgrades
- New SOUL.md — "Chief Intelligence Officer"
- 10 new skills built (crypto-analyst, roblox-game-designer, competitor-intel, freelance-hunter, pitch-writer, market-scanner, tech-radar, audience-analyzer, revenue-strategist, viral-hooks) — 18 total
- Daily morning brief standing order: AI + Crypto + Roblox at 8 AM
- Standing permission granted by Jeremy: add new skills freely without asking

## Bug: Old Build File
- Jeremy was playing an old .rbxlx that didn't have the town code
- Output log showed `[MapSetup] Map ready!` instead of `[MapSetup] World generation complete!`
- Fix: Always rebuild with Rojo before opening, or re-open the file after rebuilding
- Lesson: If Jeremy says "nothing changed," first check if he's running a stale build

## Massive Build Session (~11:00-12:00)
- Deployed 11 parallel workers (7 sub-agents + Scout + Forge + Mule)
- Sub-agents built: MiniMap, HealthBar, TradeManager, QuestManager, WeaponManager, LootManager, CraftingManager
- Map expanded 10x: 12 new areas (Farmlands, Haven Lake, Training Grounds, Ancient Grove, Outskirts Village, Watchtower Hill, Bandit Camp, Dark Forest, Dragon's Spine Mountains, Cursed Swamp, The Abyss)
- Monster system: 10 types (Chicken, Cow, Goblin, Guard Dog, Giant Rat, Training Dummy, Skeleton, Dark Wizard, Demon, Shadow Dragon boss)
- ItemDatabase expanded: 18 new items (monster drops, Dragon Sword, armor, etc.) — now 40+ items
- DataManager upgraded: Gold system, Quest tracking, Combat level, compatibility aliases
- Resource nodes: ~65 total across all areas
- Fixed: minimap (was looking at wrong folder), gate portcullis (CanCollide), bank NPC position
- Build size: 318KB, 27 script files
- Scout hit 429 rate limit, Mule out of RAM (16GB not enough with all models loaded)

## Cron Jobs Added
- Roblox Build Check-In: every 1 hour, ping Jeremy with progress

## Afternoon Build Session — Major Feature Push
- **Game renamed to "Roscape Runeblocks"** by Jeremy
- **SkillTreeUI** — full-screen skill tree, K key, XP rings, perk nodes for all 10 skills
- **StatsPanel** — RuneScape-style 3-tab (Skills/Inventory/Loadout), B key, replaces old UI panels
- **EquipmentManager** — unified equip system for Head/Body/Legs/Weapon/Shield/Tool slots
- **VisualEquipment** — equipped items render on character model
- **NPCManager** — 14 NPCs with full humanoid bodies + unique accessories (capes, staffs, hammers, boats)
- **NPCDialogUI** — dialog system with typewriter effect, shop display, quest buttons
- **PrayerManager + PrayerUI** — 13 prayers, PP drain, protection exclusivity, P key toggle
- **Gathering tools system** — 15 tools (Bronze→Dragon pickaxes/axes/rods), timed gathering with progress bar
- **Ranged + Fletching skills** — bows, crossbows, arrows, bolts, 25 new items
- **Individual loot drops** — rarity-colored neon cubes, bobbing animation, click to pick up
- **Monster leash** — 40-stud leash from spawn, forced deaggro + return home
- **10 story quests** — full chain Lv 1-75+, 3 with branching choices
- **3x XP multiplier** globally via Config.XPMultiplier
- **TEST_MODE** in GameInit — gives max stats + dragon gear for testing
- **Game website** built at website/index.html — NPCs, quests, skills, bestiary
- **Design docs**: skill-tree-and-drops.md, npcs-and-quests.md
- ItemDatabase now 75+ items, ~34 script files total

## Bugs Fixed (Afternoon)
- Floating NPCs/monsters — Y positions corrected to ground level (baseplate top = Y 0)
- `:` vs `.` on DataManager calls — colon passes self as first arg, silently fails
- EquipmentManager remote location — creates at ReplicatedStorage root, not Remotes folder
- Luau type cast `:: Type` causes parse errors — stripped all type annotations
- `PaddingAll` doesn't exist on UIPadding — must set each side individually
- `GroupTransparency` only works on CanvasGroup, not Frame
- Inventory colored borders — UIStroke per slot with rarity colors
- Grimnir overlapping banker — relocated

## Outstanding Bugs (Jeremy's Report)
1. Item visuals — colored boxes instead of recognizable icons (needs text/emoji icons)
2. ~~Floating NPCs~~ — FIXED
3. Attack animations — rbxassetid doesn't work in Studio test; mid-fix replacing with TweenService arm swing
4. Quest tab with tracking — not yet built
5. ~~Test mode~~ — FIXED

## First Reveal Standard (Jeremy's Request — 2026-02-16)
Jeremy wants this logged as the benchmark for future game reveals. When he gives a game idea, the FIRST playable reveal should include:
- **10+ skills** with progression (XP, levels, perks)
- **75+ items** (weapons, armor, tools, materials, food, drops)
- **10+ monster types** with unique visuals, AI, drops
- **14+ NPCs** with unique bodies, accessories, dialog, shops
- **10+ quests** with story, branching choices
- **Full map** with safe zone city + wilderness zones (800x800+ studs)
- **Multi-charge resource nodes** (3-8 gathers before depleting)
- **Full UI suite**: StatsPanel (B), SkillTree (K), PrayerBook (P), MiniMap (M), HealthBar, all with dark medieval theme
- **Equipment system**: visual weapons/armor on character, 6 slots
- **Banking, trading, crafting, loot drops**
- **PvP wilderness with full-loot death**
- **Working minimap** with legend, compass, zoom, tooltips
- **Game website** with NPCs, quests, skills, bestiary
- **Design docs** (skills, items, NPCs, quests)
- **TEST_MODE** for rapid testing
- Basically: a COMPLETE game framework, not a prototype. ~34 script files, ~75+ items, fully playable.

## Key Lessons Added
- Monster/NPC Y positioning: baseplate top = Y 0, body center = bodyHeight/2
- Always use dot notation on module calls: `Module.Func(arg)` not `Module:Func(arg)`
- EquipmentManager fires EquipmentChanged BindableEvent — VisualEquipment listens for it
- rbxassetid animations don't work in Studio test mode — use TweenService manual arm rotation
- PowerShell `&&` not available in older versions — use `;` semicolon separator
- `GroupTransparency` only works on `CanvasGroup`, NOT `Frame`
- `PaddingAll` doesn't exist on UIPadding — must set each side individually
- Luau type annotations (`:: Type` and return types) cause parse errors — strip all

## Late Session Progress
- Built AttackAnimations.client.lua (45.7KB) — full combat animation system with sword swing, bow shot, unarmed, shield block, monster attacks, hit effects
- Built AttackVisualHandler.server.lua (3.7KB) — server-side broadcast for attack visuals
- Added AttackVisual, HitEffect, MonsterAttackVisual remotes to project.json
- Updated MonsterManager with BroadcastMonsterAttack and BroadcastHitEffect
- NPC visual overhaul — all 14 NPCs with faces, hair, detailed accessories
- Monster visual overhaul — MonsterDatabase.lua expanded to 61KB with multi-part models
- Weapon/armor visual overhaul — multi-part welded swords/shields/helmets/armor/bows
- Sword grip fix — Handle at CFrame(0,0,0), blade extends downward (negative Y)
- Haven wall layout documented: Back Z=-10, Left X=-62, Right X=62, Front Z=108, floor 120x116 at (0,0.1,49)

## Still TODO
- Add Haven entrances on north/west/east walls (only south gate exists)
- Fill 800x800 map with terrain (hills, valleys, no empty space)
- Fix inventory item visuals (colored boxes → text icons)
- Build quest tab with tracking
- Update roblox-game-builder skill with all new lessons
- Log monetization idea (2x XP boosts tiered pricing)
