## 🔥 Why Kermicle Media?

- **You shoot, we polish.** No need to learn editing software.
- **Consistent posting = growth.** The algorithm rewards accounts that show up regularly.
- **Local expertise.** We understand small business content — not generic templates.
- **Real human editor.** Not an AI filter. Not a template app. Actual professional editing.
- **Cancel anytime.** No long-term contracts. Stay because the content slaps, not because you're locked in.

## 📊 The Math

A single well-edited Reel can reach 10,000+ people organically. That's the equivalent of a $50-$100 ad spend — for free. At 8 Reels/month, you're looking at potential reach of **80,000+ impressions** without spending a dollar on ads.

The question isn't whether you can afford a Reels package. It's whether you can afford *not* to post.

## ❓ FAQ

**What do I need to film with?**
Your phone is perfect. iPhone or Android, just make sure it's vertical (9:16) and well-lit. We'll send you a simple shot guide.

**What if I don't know what to film?**
Standard and Premium packages include content ideas. Premium includes a full strategy call where we plan everything together.

**Can I rollover unused Reels?**
Up to 2 unused Reels can roll over to the next month. Use it or lose it after that.

**Do you post for me?**
Not currently — we deliver ready-to-post files with captions and hashtags. You hit publish. (Social media management add-on coming soon.)

**What if I need more than 12 Reels/month?**
Let's talk. Custom packages available for high-volume clients.
