# Cold Outreach DM Templates for Kermicle Media
*Generated by Mule — 2026-02-14*

## 1. 🍽️ Restaurant / Bar

> Hey [Name]! 👋 I've been following your page and your food looks amazing — but I think your content could be doing even more for you. I'm a local photo/video editor and I help restaurants turn their menu into scroll-stopping content. Think moody lighting, steam rising, that "I need to eat there NOW" energy. Would you be open to a quick test edit? I'll rework one of your existing photos for free so you can see the difference. No strings. 🎬

## 2. 🏠 Real Estate Agent

> Hi [Name]! I noticed you're listing some great properties — have you thought about leveling up your listing photos and walkthrough videos? I specialize in editing real estate content that makes homes feel aspirational. Clean color correction, virtual twilight edits, smooth video tours with music. Listings with pro-edited media sell faster — I'd love to show you what I can do with one of your current shoots. Worth a quick chat?

## 3. 💪 Fitness Trainer / Gym

> Hey [Name]! Your transformation content is fire 🔥 — just wanted to reach out because I help fitness creators and trainers make their content look *cinematic*. Bold edits, clean transitions, the kind of Reels that make people stop scrolling and hit follow. I could take your existing workout clips and turn them into something that looks like a Nike ad. Want me to do a sample edit on one of your recent posts? Free, just to show you the vibe.

## 4. 👗 Local Boutique / Fashion Shop

> Hi [Name]! Love what you're doing with your shop — your pieces deserve content that matches the quality. I'm a local photo/video editor and I help boutiques create polished lookbook-style content from their existing photos. Think clean backgrounds, consistent color grading, and Reels that actually convert browsers into buyers. I'd love to rework one of your product shots as a free sample — interested?

## 5. 🎉 Event Planner / Venue

> Hey [Name]! Your events look incredible — I'm a local editor who specializes in turning raw event footage into highlight reels and promo content. The kind of stuff that makes couples say "I need to book them." Cinematic color grading, beat-synced cuts, the works. If you've got any recent event footage sitting on a hard drive, I'd love to turn a clip into a sample reel for you. No cost, just want to show you what's possible.

## Tips
- **Personalize each DM** — mention a specific post or dish or listing you saw
- **Free sample edit = foot in the door** — low risk for them, high conversion for you
- **Follow them first** and engage with a few posts before DMing
- **Follow up once** after 3-5 days if no reply, then move on
