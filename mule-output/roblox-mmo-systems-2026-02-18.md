## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### RemoteEvents Added to default.project.json:
```json
"StartWoodcutting": { "$className": "RemoteEvent" },
"WoodcuttingProgress": { "$className": "RemoteEvent" },
"WoodcuttingComplete": { "$className": "RemoteEvent" },
"PartyInvite": { "$className": "RemoteEvent" },
"PartyAccept": { "$className": "RemoteEvent" },
"PartyLeave": { "$className": "RemoteEvent" },
"PartyKick": { "$className": "RemoteEvent" },
"PartyUpdate": { "$className": "RemoteEvent" },
"PartyChat": { "$className": "RemoteEvent" }
```

### Code Standards Followed:
- All RemoteEvents in default.project.json under Remotes folder
- WaitForChild with 5 second timeouts
- No PaddingAll - individual PaddingTop/Bottom/Left/Right
- Forward-declared local functions before referencing
- require() only for ModuleScripts, not Scripts
- Dark fantasy UI theme: Color3.fromRGB(20,20,25) backgrounds, Color3.fromRGB(218,165,32) gold accents
