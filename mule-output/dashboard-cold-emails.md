## Template 1: Problem-Solution (Most Effective)

**Subject:** Replace 10+ tools with one dashboard for your clients

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you help [their client type - e.g., small businesses, consultants, etc.] with [their service - e.g., business growth, marketing, etc.].

Your clients are probably dealing with:
- 7+ different software subscriptions ($300+/month)
- Data scattered across platforms
- Hours wasted on manual reporting
- No real-time business insights

What if you could replace all that with **one AI-powered dashboard** that you white-label and charge $300-500/month for?

The AI Business Command Center gives you 13 specialized panels that replace:
✅ CRM systems
✅ Project management tools  
✅ Revenue tracking
✅ Analytics dashboards
✅ And 9 more tools

You install it once, brand it as your own, and offer it as a premium service.

**Result:** Add $300-500/month in recurring revenue per client.

Quick question: Would you be open to a 15-minute demo this week to see how it works?

Best,
[Your Name]

**PS:** We have coaches already making $3,000+/month from this. The white-label license is $997 one-time (unlimited clients).

**The math:**

We provide everything:

## Objection Handling

### **"It's too expensive."**
"At $997, it pays for itself with your first client in 3-4 months. After that, it's pure profit. What other investment gives you unlimited recurring revenue for a one-time fee?"

### **"I'm not technical."**
"We provide step-by-step installation videos. Most coaches have it set up in 30 minutes. No coding required."

### **"My clients won't pay for it."**
"Your clients are already paying $300+/month for the tools this replaces. You're saving them money while giving them better visibility."

### **"I need to think about it."**
"Absolutely. Many coaches think about it for 30 days while others are already making money. The 30-day money-back guarantee means you can try it risk-free. Would you like to see a quick demo first?"

### **"I'll wait for a discount."**
"The price increases to $1,497 on Friday. At $997, you only need one client at $300/month to recover your investment in 4 months. Waiting costs you potential revenue."

**Start sending today.** First sale funds the entire operation.
