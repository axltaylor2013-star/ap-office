## Post 3: Phone Filming Tips for Reels
**Platform:** Instagram Reel (talking head + demo)
**Best posting time:** Wednesday 9am–11am EST

**Visual:** Jeremy talking to camera with text overlays for each tip. Quick demos of each one (lock focus, clean lens, etc.)

**Caption:**
> Stop blaming your phone. Start blaming your technique.
>
> 5 things that instantly make your Reels look more professional — no fancy gear needed:
>
> 1️⃣ **Clean your lens.** Seriously. Right now. It's disgusting.
> 2️⃣ **Lock your exposure & focus.** Tap and hold on your subject. No more random refocusing mid-clip.
> 3️⃣ **Film in natural light.** Face a window. Overhead fluorescents are not your friend.
> 4️⃣ **Shoot vertical (9:16).** If I have to crop your horizontal footage one more time… 😤
> 5️⃣ **Film in 4K.** Your phone can do it. Settings → Camera → 4K 30fps. More resolution = more editing flexibility.
>
> Do these 5 things and your editor (hi, that's me) will love you forever.
>
> Save this. You'll need it. 🔖

## Post 4: Day in the Life — AI-Powered Editing Business
**Platform:** X (Thread) + repurpose as TikTok
**Best posting time:** Monday 8am–10am EST

**X Thread:**

> **1/** Day in the life of running an editing business in 2026 — where half my toolkit is AI. 🧵
>
> **2/** 7am — Coffee. Open Premiere. 3 client projects in the queue. First up: restaurant promo video. Raw footage looks like it was shot during a power outage. Classic.
>
> **3/** I run it through AI color correction first — gets me 70% there in seconds. Then I manually dial in the skin tones, the food warmth, the mood. AI gives me speed. My eye gives it soul.
>
> **4/** 10am — Photo batch for a boutique. 25 product shots. AI background removal handles the tedious stuff. I focus on color consistency and making each piece feel premium. What used to take 3 hours now takes 1.
>
> **5/** 1pm — Editing Reels for a fitness trainer. AI-generated captions save me 20 minutes per video. I still retime every cut by hand because pacing is *feeling*, not math.
>
> **6/** 4pm — Client review calls. Send previews. Get feedback. Make revisions. The human part AI can't touch.
>
> **7/** The truth about AI in editing: it doesn't replace me. It replaces the boring parts so I can focus on the creative parts. My clients get better work, faster. That's the whole game.
>
> **8/** If you're a small business posting content that looks "fine" — imagine what "great" could do for your sales. DM me. First edit is free. 🎬 kermiclemedia.com

## Post 5: Hook-First — Businesses Losing Money Without Reels
**Platform:** TikTok / Instagram Reel
**Best posting time:** Friday 12pm–2pm EST

**Visual:** Camera close on face, intense energy. Bold text overlays slamming in with each stat. Fast cuts.

**Caption:**
> Your business is invisible and it's your fault.
>
> Here's what's happening while you're "too busy" to post Reels:
>
> 📉 Your competitor posted 3 Reels this week — they got 40,000 views. You got 0.
> 📉 73% of consumers say short-form video helps them make buying decisions.
> 📉 Instagram pushes Reels 2x more than static posts in the algorithm.
> 📉 Every week you don't post, you're paying rent on a storefront with the lights off.
>
> You don't need to become a content creator. You need to send me your phone footage and let me turn it into content that actually works.
>
> The first edit is free. DM me "REELS" and stop being invisible.
