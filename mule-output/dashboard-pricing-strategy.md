## 🎯 Target: Business Coaches (Easiest Sale)

### **Why Coaches Buy:**
1. **Recurring Revenue:** Add $300-500/month per client
2. **Value Add:** Premium service for existing clients
3. **Differentiation:** Stand out from other coaches
4. **Scalability:** Unlimited clients with same system

### **Coach Economics:**
```
Current:
- Charges client: $1,000/month
- Deliverables: Calls, emails, advice

With Dashboard:
- Charges client: $1,300-1,500/month
- Deliverables: Calls + dashboard access
- Extra revenue: $300-500/month pure profit
- Client value: 30-50% more for dashboard
```

### **Sales Script (Phone/Demo):**
"Most of your clients are using 5-7 different tools to run their business. They're paying $300+/month and still don't have clear visibility.

What if you could give them one dashboard that replaces all those tools, and charge them $300-500/month for it?

You'd make extra revenue, they'd save money and get better insights, and you'd stand out as the tech-forward coach.

The system is ready to white-label. You add your logo, offer it to clients, and keep 100% of the $300-500/month.

## 💬 Objection Handling Cheat Sheet

### **"I need to think about it."**
"Absolutely. Many coaches think about it for 30 days while the smart ones are already making money. The 30-day guarantee means you can try it risk-free. Would you like to see a quick demo first?"

### **"It's too expensive."**
"At $997, it pays for itself with your first client in 3-4 months. What other investment gives you unlimited recurring revenue for a one-time fee? Most coaches make their money back within 30 days."

### **"My clients won't pay extra."**
"Your clients are already paying $300+/month for the tools this replaces. You're actually saving them money while giving them better visibility. It's an easy value-add."

### **"I'm not technical."**
"We provide step-by-step videos. Most coaches have it set up in 30 minutes. No coding required. Or choose our done-for-you setup for $500 extra."

### **"Let me talk to my partner."**
"Great! When would be a good time for all three of us to jump on a quick call? I can show you both how it works in 10 minutes."
