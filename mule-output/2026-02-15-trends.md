## 📈 Trending Topics

### 1. Adobe Firefly Video Generation (GA)
Adobe's Firefly video model is now generally available inside Premiere Pro. Generates B-roll, extends clips, and creates transitions from text prompts. Freelance editors who learn this fast will deliver faster and charge the same — pure margin gain. **Action:** Experiment with Firefly for filler/transition content in client projects.

### 2. Smartphone RAW Workflows Going Mainstream
iPhone 16 Pro and Samsung S26 Ultra shooting ProRes/RAW is normalizing "shoot on phone, edit like cinema." More small business clients are shooting their own content on phones and need someone to make it look professional. **Action:** Market a "phone footage rescue" service — clients shoot, Jeremy polishes.

### 3. AI Voice Cloning for Video Narration
Tools like ElevenLabs and PlayHT now offer studio-quality voice cloning in seconds. Video editors can add professional narration to client projects without booking VO talent. **Action:** Offer narration as an upsell on video editing packages — minimal extra work, higher ticket.

### 4. Subscription Editing Services Growing
More competitors shifting to monthly retainer models ($300-$900/mo for ongoing edits). Clients prefer predictable costs. Freelancers with retainers get stable income. **Action:** Push the monthly retainer package from the pricing page harder — it's the most defensible revenue.

### 5. Short-Form Vertical Video Still Dominating
TikTok, Reels, and Shorts remain the #1 discovery channel for local businesses. Businesses that post 4-5 Reels/week see 3-5x more profile visits. Most small businesses don't have time to edit that volume. **Action:** Offer a "Reels Package" — 8-12 short clips/month from raw footage the client provides.

## 🔥 Viral Content Ideas

### 1. "Fix My Photo" Challenge
Post a badly-edited or unedited photo and ask followers to guess what you'd change. Then reveal the pro edit. Drives comments (algorithm gold) and showcases skill. Works as a recurring series.

### 2. "Same Footage, 3 Moods"
Take one clip and edit it three ways — horror, romance, corporate. Shows the power of editing and is inherently shareable. Trending audio + split screen format.

### 3. "Client Said It Was Unusable" Series
Show the worst raw footage/photos clients have sent, then the final delivered product. Satisfying transformation content + social proof in one post. Always performs.
