### Sample Templates by Industry

#### Marketing Agency Outreach
```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Agency Name] has grown to [X] team members - congratulations on building such a strong client roster! 

I work with marketing agencies who are hitting that growth challenge where taking on more clients means working longer hours instead of just making more profit.

We've helped similar agencies automate their reporting, lead processing, and client communication - freeing up 15-25 hours/week to focus on strategy instead of admin work.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about what operational efficiency looks like in your agency? I'd love to share what we've learned from working with [similar business type].

Best regards,
Jeremy Kermicle
```

#### Real Estate Team Outreach  
```
Hi [Name],

Saw that [Team Name] closed [X] transactions last quarter - impressive numbers in this market!

I'm curious - as your team grows, are you finding that the administrative side (lead follow-up, transaction coordination, client updates) is taking more and more time away from actually working with clients?

We specialize in helping real estate teams automate the repetitive parts of the business so agents can focus on relationships and closings. 

Quick question: what's eating up most of your time that isn't directly generating commissions? I might have some insights that could help.

Best,
Jeremy
