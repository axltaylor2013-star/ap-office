## Objection Handling Scripts

### "It's too expensive"
"I understand price is a consideration. Let's look at it this way - you're currently spending [X] hours per week on [MANUAL_PROCESS]. At your time value of $[RATE]/hour, that's $[MONTHLY_COST] monthly. This system pays for itself in [X] months and saves you $[ANNUAL_SAVINGS] per year after that. It's actually costing you money NOT to automate."

### "We're too small"
"Actually, smaller businesses benefit most from automation because every hour saved has bigger impact. Large companies can afford to have people doing manual work. You can't afford NOT to automate. Plus, our packages start at $2,200 - designed specifically for businesses your size."

### "We don't have time to implement"
"That's exactly why you need this. The implementation is only 2-4 weeks, but the time savings start immediately. You'll recover the implementation time within the first month, then save [X] hours every week going forward. Can you afford not to find 2 weeks to save 20 hours every week for years?"

### "What if it doesn't work?"
"Fair question. That's why we guarantee the ROI projections we show you. If the system doesn't save you the promised time within 60 days, we'll refine it until it does or refund your money. We've never had to do that because we only propose solutions we know work."

### "We need to think about it"
"Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specific concerns do you have? Is it the ROI projections, the timeline, or something else? I'd rather address those now than have you wonder about them."

## Qualification Framework

### Budget Qualification
- "What's your current monthly budget for business improvements?"

### Authority Qualification  
- "Who else is involved in decisions like this?"
- "What's your process for approving business investments?"
- "Do you need buy-in from anyone else?"

### Need Qualification
- "What's the biggest time waster in your business right now?"
- "How many hours per week do you spend on administrative tasks?"
- "What would happen if you could automate [SPECIFIC_PROCESS]?"

### Timeline Qualification
- "When would you like to have this implemented?"
- "Is there urgency around solving [SPECIFIC_PROBLEM]?"
- "What's driving the timing for this project?"
