# Animatic Visual Style Guide

## Style Anchor (prefix every prompt with this)

> "2D cartoon style, bold outlines, vibrant colors, flat shading with subtle cel-shading, expressive characters, clean vector-like art"

## Visual Rules

- **Line weight**: Bold black outlines (2-3px equivalent)
- **Shading**: Flat color fills with one shadow tone per surface (cel-shading)
- **Colors**: Vibrant and saturated, avoid muted palettes
- **Backgrounds**: Simplified but readable — establish setting without overwhelming detail
- **Expressions**: Exaggerated and emotive — this is a cartoon, push the emotion
- **Proportions**: Slightly stylized (larger heads/eyes for expressiveness)

## Camera Angles

- **Wide shot**: Establishing scenes, showing environment
- **Medium shot**: Dialogue scenes, character interactions (most common)
- **Close-up**: Emotional beats, reactions, important details
- **Over-the-shoulder**: Conversation framing
- **Low angle**: Power/intimidation moments
- **High angle**: Vulnerability moments

## Lighting

- Default: Bright, even cartoon lighting
- Night scenes: Blue-tinted shadows, warm light sources
- Dramatic moments: High contrast, rim lighting
- Outdoor: Warm golden tones, clear shadows

## Panel Composition

- Rule of thirds for character placement
- Leave space for dialogue/captions if needed
- Action flows left to right
- Important elements at eye level or slightly above center

## Negative Prompts (add to every generation)

> "3D render, photorealistic, blurry, deformed, extra limbs, bad anatomy, watermark, signature, low quality"
