---

### Quest 2: "The Smith's Favor"
**Giver:** Grimnir the Smith
**Level:** 5

---

### Quest 3: "Eyes on the Wilderness"  
**Giver:** Scout Wren (Guard Tower)
**Level:** 10
**Type:** Exploration / First Wilderness Trip

> *"I've been watching from this tower for months. The monsters are getting bolder — I saw skeletons near the border yesterday. I need someone to scout closer. Are you brave... or stupid enough?"*

**Objectives:**
1. Travel to the Wilderness border (cross the line!)
2. Kill 3 Goblins near the border
3. Collect 1 Goblin Mail as proof
4. Find Scout Wren's lost spyglass (hidden in the Forgotten Graveyard)
5. Return to Scout Wren

**Rewards:** 1,000 Gold, Wooden Shield, Wren's Compass (shows distance to Haven on screen), 500 XP (Combat)

---

### Quest 4: "The Restless Dead"
**Giver:** Grave Keeper Morath (Forgotten Graveyard)  
**Level:** 15
**Type:** Combat / Mystery

> *"They won't stay buried. Every night, more dig themselves out. Something is calling them from deep underground. The graves are... humming."*

2. Collect 3 "Ancient Bone Fragments" (rare drop from Skeletons during quest)
3. Examine the Humming Grave (interact with a specific headstone)
4. Report findings to Brother Elden at the Chapel

**Rewards:** 1,500 Gold, Iron Sword, Prayer Amulet (+5% XP from all skills), 800 XP (Combat)

**Story:** The humming grave contains a sealed stone tablet with strange runes. Brother Elden recognizes the runes as belonging to an ancient order called the "Runesmiths" — they created the first rune weapons, but also something terrible. He's visibly shaken.

---

### Quest 5: "The Witch's Bargain"
**Giver:** Brother Elden (Chapel of Light)
**Level:** 20
**Type:** Exploration / Moral Choice

> *"There's a witch in the Dark Forest — Thessaly. She was once a Runesmith before they cast her out. She may know what these runes mean. But be careful... she always wants something in return."*

**Objectives:**
1. Travel to the Dark Forest
2. Find Witch Thessaly's Hut
3. Give her the Stone Tablet
4. **CHOICE:** 
   - **Option A:** Gather 10 Rat Tails + 5 Shadow Gems for her potion → She translates the tablet and gives you a Dark Talisman
   - **Option B:** Refuse her price, steal the translation → She curses you (-10% speed for 30 minutes) but you keep the Shadow Gems

**Rewards:** 2,000 Gold, Dark Talisman OR Shadow Gem stash, 1,000 XP (Combat), Translation of the Rune Tablet

**Story:** Thessaly reveals the tablet is a warning: *"The Runesmiths bound a dragon in shadow and stone. The seal is breaking. When the last rune fades, the Shadow Dragon will consume everything."* She either helps willingly or grudgingly. The choice affects her attitude in later quests.

---

### Quest 6: "The Bandit Problem"
**Giver:** Captain Aldric (Haven Gate)
**Level:** 25
**Type:** Combat / Diplomacy

> *"Bandits have set up camp in the hills. They're raiding supply caravans. I need them gone — but I can't spare any guards. The Wilderness monsters are too close to the walls."*

**Objectives:**
1. Travel to the Bandit Camp
2. **CHOICE:**
   - **Option A: Fight** — Defeat 8 Bandits + Bandit King Rask (mini-boss, Lv 30, 500 HP)
   - **Option B: Negotiate** — Bring Rask 50 Cooked Lobster + 5,000 Gold → He agrees to stop raiding
3. Retrieve the Stolen Supply Crate
4. Return to Aldric

**Rewards:**
- **Fight path:** 3,000 Gold, Rask's Blade (unique weapon, 20 dmg + 5% lifesteal), 1,500 XP (Combat)
- **Negotiate path:** Bandits become neutral (won't attack you), Rask gives you a Bandit's Cloak (stealth item — monsters detect you 30% later), 1,500 XP (Combat)

**Story:** Either way, Rask reveals that the bandits fled TO the camp — they were driven out of the deep Wilderness by "something waking up." Even hardened criminals are scared.

---

### Quest 7: "Echoes of the Runesmiths"
**Giver:** The Oracle (Ancient Grove)
**Level:** 35
**Type:** Puzzle / Exploration

> *"You carry the tablet's words. Good. Now you must find the three Runestones — scattered when the order fell. One in fire, one in water, one in shadow. Only together can they reveal the sealing ritual."*

**Objectives:**
1. Find the **Fire Runestone** — hidden in the Lava Pit area (survive fire damage, solve a stepping-stone puzzle)
2. Find the **Water Runestone** — at the bottom of Haven Lake (need Aqua Breathing perk OR a special item from Thessaly)
3. Find the **Shadow Runestone** — in the deepest part of the Dark Forest (fight through Dark Wizards, Lv 40)
4. Bring all three to The Oracle

**Rewards:** 4,000 Gold, Runesmith's Ring (unique accessory — +10% all XP), 2,000 XP (split across all skills), Unlock Dragon's Spine access

**Story:** The Oracle assembles the runestones and they project a hologram of the ancient sealing ritual. The Shadow Dragon was a regular dragon, corrupted by a Runesmith who wanted unlimited power. The Runesmiths sealed it, but the seal is degrading. The Oracle tells you the seal can only be restored — or the dragon destroyed — at the peak of Dragon's Spine Mountains.

---

### Quest 8: "The Ghost Knight's Duty"
**Giver:** Ghost of Sir Aldren (Ancient Ruins)
**Level:** 45
**Type:** Combat / Emotional

> *"I was the last knight to face the dragon. I... failed. My body lies somewhere in these ruins, but my sword — the Runebreaker — I hid it where the dragon could never find it. You'll need it."*

**Objectives:**
1. Search the Ancient Ruins for Sir Aldren's journal (find hidden room)
2. Read the journal — learn the location of the Runebreaker sword
3. Travel to the Dragon's Spine Mountains
4. Navigate the mountain path (avoid falling rocks, fight Mountain Golems — new Lv 50 enemy)
5. Retrieve the Runebreaker from the hidden cave

**Rewards:** 5,000 Gold, **Runebreaker** (legendary sword — 45 dmg, +25% damage vs Shadow Dragon), 3,000 XP (Combat)

**Story:** The journal is heartbreaking — Sir Aldren wrote about his family in Haven, his duty, and his fear. When you find the Runebreaker, his ghost appears and thanks you. He can finally rest. *"End what I could not. For Haven. For everyone."* He fades away permanently.

---

### Quest 9: "Into the Abyss"
**Giver:** Dragon Priestess Lyra (Dragon's Spine Mountains)
**Level:** 60
**Type:** Dungeon / Gauntlet

> *"The dragon sleeps in The Abyss, but it stirs. To reach it, you must pass through the Cursed Swamp and survive the Abyss Gauntlet — a tunnel of the dragon's nightmares made real."*

**Objectives:**
1. Cross the Cursed Swamp (poison damage, slow movement, fight Swamp Creatures)
2. Enter The Abyss
3. Survive the **Abyss Gauntlet** — 3 waves of enemies:
   - Wave 1: 10 Skeletons (Lv 30)
   - Wave 2: 5 Dark Wizards (Lv 40) + 3 Demons (Lv 60)
   - Wave 3: **Corrupted Knight** (mini-boss, Lv 75, 2,000 HP — a dark version of Sir Aldren)
4. Reach the Dragon's Lair entrance
5. Use the Runestones to unseal the door

**Rewards:** 7,500 Gold, Abyss Walker Boots (immune to poison + 10% speed), 5,000 XP (Combat), Access to Shadow Dragon boss fight

**Story:** The Corrupted Knight is a twisted shadow copy of Sir Aldren — proof of the dragon's power to corrupt. Fighting it is emotionally heavy. When defeated, it whispers *"Thank... you..."* Lyra warns this is only a taste of the dragon's power.

---

### Quest 10: "The Shadow Dragon"
**Giver:** Dragon Priestess Lyra (The Abyss — Dragon's Lair)
**Level:** 75+
**Type:** BOSS FIGHT / Finale

> *"This is it. Beyond this door lies the Shadow Dragon — the beast that destroyed the Runesmiths, killed Sir Aldren, took Grimnir's arm, and poisoned the Wilderness. You carry the Runebreaker, the Runestones, and the hopes of Haven. Don't die."*

**Objectives:**
1. Enter the Dragon's Lair
2. **DEFEAT THE SHADOW DRAGON** (Lv 99 Boss)
   - Phase 1 (100-60% HP): Ground combat — claw swipes, tail whips, fire breath
   - Phase 2 (60-30% HP): Dragon takes flight — ranged attacks only (bows/crossbows!)
   - Phase 3 (30-0% HP): Shadow form — arena fills with darkness, dragon teleports, AoE shadow blasts, must use Runestones to reveal it
3. After defeat: **CHOICE:**
   - **Option A: Seal the Dragon** (use Runestones) → Dragon is trapped forever, Wilderness slowly heals over time (cosmetic change to map), you get the Seal of the Runesmiths
   - **Option B: Absorb its Power** → You gain the Shadow Dragon's Aura (permanent +15% all combat stats, but your character has glowing red eyes and dark particle effects — other players can see you chose the dark path)
4. Return to Haven as a hero

**Rewards:**
- 25,000 Gold
- **Seal path:** Seal of the Runesmiths (legendary amulet — +10% all stats, gold glow, "Hero of Haven" title above your name)
- **Absorb path:** Shadow Dragon's Aura (+15% combat stats, dark visual effects, "Dragon's Vessel" title — red text)
- Dragon Scale × 5 guaranteed
- 10,000 XP (Combat)
- Unlocks **New Game+ quests** (future content)
- Haven NPCs react differently based on your choice (Brother Elden is horrified if you absorbed, Thessaly is impressed)

**Story:** The climactic battle. The Shadow Dragon speaks during the fight, taunting you with knowledge of the Runesmiths' corruption. Phase 2 forces ranged players to shine. Phase 3 is a frantic puzzle-fight. The final choice defines your character permanently — and other players can see which path you chose.
