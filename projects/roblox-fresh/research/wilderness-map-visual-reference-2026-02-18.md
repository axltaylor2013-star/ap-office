## Player Flow Patterns

### Expected Traffic Patterns:

#### New Players (Hours 0-10):
```
Spawn in Haven City → Tutorial area → Central Plaza
↓
Choose first skill → Corresponding low-risk zone
↓
Return to Haven City to bank/sell
↓
Repeat with other low-risk zones
```

#### Intermediate Players (Hours 10-50):
```
Haven City → Medium-risk zone for specialization
↓
Gather resources → Return to craft/sell
↓
Group for dungeon (Sunken Ruins, etc.)
↓
Return with loot → Upgrade equipment
```

#### Advanced Players (Hours 50+):
```
Haven City → Wilderness zone for high-value resources
↓
PvP encounters → Loot gains/losses
↓
Return to safe zones cautiously
↓
Bank valuable items → Return to wilderness
```

### Choke Points & Strategic Locations:
1. **Ironpeak Pass:** Only land route north-south
2. **Crystal Lake Bridge:** Main crossing to east
3. **Volcanic Fissure:** Shortcut through Ashen Wastes
4. **Forest Path:** Main road through Greenwood
5. **Swamp Crossing:** Dangerous but faster route

## Performance Zones

### High Detail Areas (0-1000 studs from player):
- Haven City interiors
- Resource node clusters
- Dungeon entrances
- Player housing areas

### Medium Detail Areas (1000-2000 studs):

- Major roads
- Resource zones
- Combat areas

### Low Detail Areas (2000+ studs):
- Distant terrain
- Background mountains
- Skyboxes
- Far water

### Culling Boundaries:

- Vertical culling: Don't render underground from surface
- Occlusion: Buildings block rendering of areas behind
- Distance fade: Gradually reduce detail with distance

## Lighting Zones

### Time of Day Variations:

#### Daytime (06:00-18:00 game time):
- All zones: Normal lighting
- Forests: Dappled sunlight through trees
- Mountains: Strong directional shadows

#### Nighttime (18:00-06:00 game time):
- Safe zones: Well-lit with lanterns/torches
- Wilderness: Dark with minimal lighting
- Dungeons: Torch/candle light only
- Special: Moonlight affects certain areas

#### Special Lighting Conditions:
- **Ashen Wastes:** Permanent orange glow (volcanic)
- **Frozen Tundra:** Blue-white ambient (snow reflection)

## Navigation Tips for Players

### Starting Out:
1. Stay in Haven City until you understand basic mechanics
2. Use the map markers to find skill tutors
3. Bank frequently when carrying valuable items
4. Stick to low-risk zones until level 10 in combat skills

### Intermediate:
1. Learn zone landmarks for navigation without map
2. Use roads for safe travel between zones
3. Watch for other players in medium-risk zones
4. Form groups for dungeon exploration

### Advanced:
1. Memorize wilderness choke points and ambush spots
2. Travel light in PvP zones
3. Use terrain for cover and escape routes
4. Scout areas before gathering valuable resources

### General:
1. The sun/moon rises in east, sets in west
2. Rivers flow from mountains to lake/sea
3. Higher elevation = colder temperatures
4. Safe zones are always well-lit at night
